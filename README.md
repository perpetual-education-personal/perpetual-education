### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're training a new generation of designers and developers.

Want to learn to wield the power of the world's most powerful communication platform? In the shortest possible time - and have the most fun? With the least opportunity cost? Too good to be true... right? Not really. Learning "all by yourself" - is overrated. Do the math.

You are probably already a developer (because you are here). BUT, if you know someone _just starting to learn_ - or even CS majors who want to learn UX and web developement - and you want to do them a _huge favor_, have them give us a call. We provide free advice and career guidance - with absolutely **no** pressure to choose our program. We only want to help people find the best path for them - because we never had that available to us. You can even [get paid](https://perpetual.education/get-paid-to-match-students/) for successful referals.

It might be hard to believe - but we are just _humans_ who want to help people. By assisting people to become courageous and responsible designers and developers - we are creating a better world. And - it's actually very selfish. You caught us! We like the idea of a better world - because we'll be living here - until we die. ; )

(link ^ to Killer Mike's thoughts on school). We agree. We need more power to more people ASAP. Help us to nominate people for our scholarship programs.

[Our site](https://perpetual.education) should explain it all.
